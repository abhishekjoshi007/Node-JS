    // Expressjs is all about middleware.Middleware means that an incoming request is automatically 
    // funneled through a bunch of functions by expressjs,
    // so instead of just having one request handler, you will actually have a possibility of hooking
    // in multiple functions which the request will go through until you send a response.

    // This allows you to split your code into multiple blocks or pieces instead of having one huge function


// Ì£middleware  


//use is a method define by the express framework. Use allows us to add a new middleware function, now the use method 
// is pretty flexible,it accepts an array of so-called request handlers here and it has some other use cases too.
// Now one easy way of using it is that you simply pass a function to it and this function here, this function
// you pass to app use will be executed for every incoming request and this function will receive three arguments,

// app.use((req,res,next) => {
    
//     console.log('In The Middleware');
    
//     //Allows the req to continue to the next middleware in line
//     next();
       
       //for sending res
       //res.send('html here');

// });

//using body parser it register a middleware which is used to parsed the incoming request bodies
// (urlencoded) and next is by default called.
//It does body parsering and using package bodyparser.Using for (console.log(req.body);)
app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({extended:false}));
